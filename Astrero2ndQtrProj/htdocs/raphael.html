		<h1> Raphael Kedrey </h1>
		<h3> The Villainess Is A Marionette </h3>
			<p> The Male Protagonist of the story. He's often described and seen as someone who's cold, distant, and unapproachable. It;s because of the phobia he developed; he doesn't like touching people. But surprisingly, Cayena is an exemption to all of this. He doesn't feel disgusted with her touch and she let him feel various emotions that are surreal and unfamiliar to him. Before he knew it, he's fallen for her. His "cold" aura immediately disappears when Cayena is around, he even acts like a cute puppy around her, blushing and everything.  <br> </p>
