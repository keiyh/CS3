		<h1> Cosette Parvis </h1>
		<h3> I Am The Real One </h3>
			<p> The main antagonist and villainess of the story. She is Keira's sister, the protagonist of the story. In the first timeline, she was introduced to the family and Keira was claimed to be a "fake" daughter. She was taken into the house to prove herself and slowly but surely, she gathered the trust of the people and the kingdom. Eventually proving herself to be the true daughter, their father had Keira executed for "deceiving the empire. In the second timeline and current timeline, Keira went back in time and plans to stop and get revenge on Cosette. I hate to see her lose, but at least Keira is slaying in the current timeline. <br> </p>
