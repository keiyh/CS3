		<h1> Cassis Pedelian </h1>
		<h3> Roxana: The Way To Protect The Female Lead's Older Brother </h3>
			<p> The male love interest of the story. Casis is the older brother of Sylvia who got caught by Lant Agriche (Roxana's Father) lurking around the borders of Agriche. He was given to Roxana as a "toy" to be played and used for their own pleasures. He was expecting Roxana to be the same as her father but he was surprised when Roxana treated him with care and did not treat him as some sort of "toy". He became very curious with her and her secrets that he didn't notice himself slowly falling for her. She helped him in escaping, and Cassis promised he would come back and get Roxana.<br> </p>
