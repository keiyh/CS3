		<h3> Welcome to the About Section of the site!  </h3>
		<p> Unseen panels: treasured drawings; is a page or site wherein I upload panels of my favorite characters. The panels are those that I treasure so much. The reason? be it either because they looked beautiful and gorgeous in that photo, or the art was heavenly in that very specific panel. <br> <br>

		But Unseen Panels is not limited to photos of characters only, this site also contains their: basic info, the things i like about them, and of course- my favorite panels of them. <br> <br>
		
		The main inspiration as to why I created this page is because of my love for Cayena. I want people to get to know her since I love her very much and she deserves the world. <br> <br>
		
		With the completion of this page, I wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for Abi and Hillary helping me while coding my home page, love u guys lol! <br> <br>

		i hope you'll enjoy exploring this site, and get to know my favorite characters! Have fun! a compilation of profiles of manhwa characters I like.
