		<h1> Penelope Eckart </h1>
		<h3> Villains Are Destined To Die </h3>
			<p> The main protagonist of the story. In her previous life before reincarnating, she was a daughter who was casted aside all the time. Yes, she may have been adopted by her biological father after her mother died, but her half-brothers scorned and hated her. After playing a game and falling asleep, she then reincarnated into the game she was playing, as Penelope- who pretty much had the same backstory. The Duke who happened to be passing by, adopted Penelope due to her pink hair. She was considered a replacement for the real daughter who went missing, Yvonne. But reincarnated Penny tried her best to survive and not get killed, like what happened in the game when Yvonne returned. And in the current timeline, she's slaying it and even got herself a harem.   <br> </p>
