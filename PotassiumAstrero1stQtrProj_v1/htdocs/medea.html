		<h1> Medea Solon </h1>
		<h3> Your Throne </h3>
			<p> The daughter of a duke who was engaged to the crown prince of the empire. She prepared all her life to be the perfect crown princess and empress. But her dreams were shattered when Prince Iaros announced that he will be marrying Psyche Callista, leaving aside and disregarding the fact that he has a fiancee. Devastated, Medea begged to "God, if you were real, please grant my wish. Let me be her, even if it's just for a day!" and with that, Psyche and Medea can now switch bodies. But they cannot do it at their own will, the other one has to be in danger in order for them to switch bodies. They then cooperate with each other- Medea, Psyche, Helio, and Perion; in order to defeat the crown prince Iaros. <br> </p>
