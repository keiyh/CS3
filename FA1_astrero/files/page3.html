        <li>Cosette Parvis is the older sister of the main character, Keira Parvis. Though they are related by blood, they do not get along well with each other. </li>
        <li> She is a manipulative villainess that once k!lled her younger sister in their past lives. After getting rid of Keira, she went on a rampage and destroyed the empire. </li>
        <li> She's the spitting image of Ludwig, that's why people doubt Keira is a real daughter. Appearance wise, she has golden blonde hair and red fiery eyes.</li>
